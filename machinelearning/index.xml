      <description>Random Forests explained intuitively Original Post:https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/random-forests-explained-intuitively
What is the Random Forest Forest Random forest is a collection of many decision trees. Instead of relying on a single decision tree, you build many decision trees say 100 of them. And you know what a collection of trees is called - forest.
Random There are two levels of randomness in this alforithm:
 At row level: Each of these decision trees get a random sample of the training data (say 10%) each of these trees will be trained independently on 10% randomlyy chosen rows out of all rows of data.</description>

      <description>Exploratory data analysis(EDA) In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.
The objectives of EDA are to:
 Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena
 Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based
 Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
 Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments</description>
