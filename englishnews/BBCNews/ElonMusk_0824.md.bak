## Elon Musk is playing a dangerous game

There is never a !dull moment with the !mercurial Mr Musk, but he !excelled himself on Tuesday, !stunning the markets by tweeting that he was considering taking the company private by buying publicly available shares for $420 each - a significant !premium to the $340 they were trading at before he dropped his !bombshell.

If it !turns_out his Twitter promise - that he has secured the tens of billions of dollars he would need to !buy_out public !shareholders - is in any way !shaky, then he could find himself !accused of price !manipulation. It's a very serious !charge, which can !land you in !jail.

There is no doubt there is some sense in taking the company private. Private companies are not !subject_to the same !scrutiny from investors, who want to see very transparent earnings on a quarter-by-quarter basis - and if you don't deliver it, your share price can be heavily punished.

Also, Mr Musk did not enjoy having to answer the !forensic questioning of Wall Street analysts who want !minutiae on production, sals, timings, earnings !et_al. If he takes the company private, he won't have to do this. If it turns out that he doesn't have the financial !firepower to deliver on his tweet, the !regulators may think he's more than a !bonehead.
