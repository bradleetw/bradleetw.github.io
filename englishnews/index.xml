      <description>Australian boy who hacked into Apple network admired the group A 16-year-old boy hacked into Apple&amp;rsquo;s mainframe, downloaded internal files and accessed customer accounts because he was a fan of the company and hoped to work there one day, a Melbourne court has heard.
The boy, who studies in a private school, stored the saved information in a folder titled &amp;ldquo;hacky hack hack&amp;rdquo;, the newspaper said.
Despite the court being told that the teenager had downloaded 90GB of secure files and accessed customer accounts, Apple - the world&amp;rsquo;s most valuable company - has denied that customers were affected.</description>

      <description>The new Canon: the best films of the 2000s This list advances the modest proposal that, when it comes to the Canon, we expand our notions of permanence and connoisseurship to include films that are worthy of appreciation - even veneration - despite being so recent. (As for rankings, this collection is unnumbered, reflecting a loose, intuitive collection rather than a strict hierachy.) No one is a prophet in their own hometown; sometimes we need reminding that many of the films we&amp;rsquo;re seeing right now are genuinely timeless.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Please do not switch me off !&amp;rsquo;: An experiment with a begging robot shows people hesitate to pull the plug If a little humanoid robot begged you not to shut it off, would you show compassion?
In an experiment designed to investigate how people treat robots when they act like humans, many participants struggled to power down a pleading robot, named Nao, either refusing to shut it off or taking more than twice the amount of time to pull the plug.</description>

      <description>FBI seeks motive after U.S. airline worker steals plane, crashes it A Horizon Air ground service agent got into a Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft on Friday night in a maintenance area at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and took off, Horizon sister carrier Alaska Airlines said.
He flew for about one hour, often erratically with attempts at aerial stunts, before crashing onto sparsely populated Ketron Island in Puget Sound, some 25 miles to the southwest.</description>

      <description>V.S. Naipaul, who explored colonialism through unsparing books, dies at 85 V.S.

He was 85.
His family confirmed the death in a statement, The Associated Press reported.</description>

      <description>Elon Musk is playing a dangerous game There is never a dull moment with the mercurial Mr Musk, but he excelled himself on Tuesday, stunning the markets by tweeting that he was considering taking the company private by buying publicly available shares for $420 each - a significant premium to the $340 they were trading at before he dropped his bombshell.
If it turns out his Twitter promise - that he has secured the tens of billions of dollars he would need to buy out public shareholders - is in any way shaky, then he could find himself accused of price manipulation.</description>

      <description>The strange birth, death and rebirth of a Russian troll account called &amp;ldquo;AllForUSA&amp;rdquo; An Indiana man named Jesse D. Allen created a website in 2005 with the title AllForUSA.com, apparently to pursue some business interests, but he soon abandoned the site. A decade later, at the age of 80, Allen died.
But AllForUSA was just getting started.
As the 2016 presidential campaign heated up, AllForUSA.com suddenly bristled with what appeared to be news articles celebrating Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and bashing his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.</description>

      <description>Test-doctoring to keep Japanese women out of medical school Japan has made a lot of noise in recent years about demolishing the traditional view that women should stay at home while men go out to work. So it was shocking when, on August 7th, Tokyo Medical University, a prestigious medical school, confessed to marking down the test scores of female applications to keep the ratio of women in each class below 30%.</description>

      <description>Apple breaches $1 trillion stock market valuation Apple Inc on Thursday became the first $1 trillion publicly listed U.S. company, crowning a decade-long rise fueled by its ubiquitous iPhone that transformed it from a niche player in personal computers into a global powerhouse spanning entertainment and communications.
&amp;ldquo;Financial returns are simply the result of Apple&amp;rsquo;s innovation, putting our products and customers first, and always staying true to our values,&amp;rdquo; Cook said in a memo to Apple&amp;rsquo;s more than 120,000 employees on Thursday.</description>

      <description>China&amp;rsquo;s introverts find a kindred spirit: a stick figure from Finland People who live in China&amp;rsquo;s crowed cities are used to having their personal space invaded - in schools, malls, restaurants, bus stations, dormitories and even bathrooms. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they like it.
Now a growing number of them identify with a Finnish cartoon character who channels their urban anxieties, albeit in a different cultural context.
The &amp;ldquo;Finnish Nightmares&amp;rdquo; comic series documents the social challenges faced by Matti, a mild-mannered stick figure who abhors small talk.</description>
