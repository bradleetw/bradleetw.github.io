      <description>&amp;lsquo;No pain, no gain&amp;rsquo; sounds tough, but you may only be hurting yourself While training for a half-marathon last fall, Janet Sherman, 57, started noticing pain in her right leg and left foot. A diagnosis of a quadriceps strain and plantar fasciitis led to shoe inserts and cross-training. Before long, the Wyoming-based teacher was &amp;ldquo;just good enough&amp;rdquo; to get back to training, and so she did, although she opted to drop down to a shorter 10K race distance.</description>

      <description>Paw outcome? New Zealand council proposes banning all cats A regional council in New Zealand has proposed banning all domestic cats in an attempt to protect native animals.
Environment Southland&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;pest plan&amp;rdquo; calls for all domestic cats in the region to be neutered, microchipped and registered. Then, when a cat dies, residents would not be permitted to have another.
Ali Meade, the council&amp;rsquo;s biosecurity operations manager, said that if the move was approved the improvement for the environment and bird life would be vast.</description>

      <description>French baguette faces pinch from anti-salt lawmakers France&amp;rsquo;s beloved bread loaf, the baguette, may be about to lose some of its bite, with politicians looking into the health risks of additives set to propose legislation forcing bakers and processed food makers more generally to slash salt content.
After months of investigation and hearings, a parliamentary committee has come to the conclusion that voluntary agreements on the reduction of high salt levels have not been respected and that it is time to impose healthier norms via legislation.</description>

      <description>The Guardian view on alcohol: drinking less is good for you Alcohol is physically bad for you in any quantity; and the more you drink, the worse its health effects. The gigantic report on the subject published last week is unequivocal and authoritative. The report was based on enormous amounts of data: 28 million people around the world were examined in 592 studies to estimate the health risks.
The variety of ways in which alcohol can kill or damage people comes as a shock.</description>

      <description>One in five vanilla ice-creams has no vanilla, cream or fresh milk Britain&amp;rsquo;s longest heatwave since 1976 has seen vanilla ice-cream sales soar, but a survey has revealed that some brands are sold without vanilla, cream or fresh milk.
Vanilla has traditionally been Britain&amp;rsquo;s favourite flavour but a Which? investigation of supermarket and branded vanilla ice-cream found a number of them were lacking some key ingredients.
One in five of the ice-creams examined by the consumer watchdog had none of the three ingredients shoppers might reasonably expect to find in vanilla ice-cream.</description>

      <description>Murder of Didi passenger prompts China clampdown, outrage China pledged on Monday to tighten oversight of its transport industry and warned that the country did not need ride-hailing firms which compromised on passenger safety, days after a Didi Chuxing passenger was raped and murdered by her driver.
The killing of a 20-year-old passenger who rode in the Didi vehicle on Friday in the eastern city of Wenzhou is the second such incident since May, denting the image of the Beijing-based company, which is the world&amp;rsquo;s largest ride-hailing firm by number of rides and is expanding globally.</description>

      <description>Australian boy who hacked into Apple network admired the group A 16-year-old boy hacked into Apple&amp;rsquo;s mainframe, downloaded internal files and accessed customer accounts because he was a fan of the company and hoped to work there one day, a Melbourne court has heard.
The boy, who studies in a private school, stored the saved information in a folder titled &amp;ldquo;hacky hack hack&amp;rdquo;, the newspaper said.
Despite the court being told that the teenager had downloaded 90GB of secure files and accessed customer accounts, Apple - the world&amp;rsquo;s most valuable company - has denied that customers were affected.</description>

      <description>The new Canon: the best films of the 2000s This list advances the modest proposal that, when it comes to the Canon, we expand our notions of permanence and connoisseurship to include films that are worthy of appreciation - even veneration - despite being so recent. (As for rankings, this collection is unnumbered, reflecting a loose, intuitive collection rather than a strict hierachy.) No one is a prophet in their own hometown; sometimes we need reminding that many of the films we&amp;rsquo;re seeing right now are genuinely timeless.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Please do not switch me off !&amp;rsquo;: An experiment with a begging robot shows people hesitate to pull the plug If a little humanoid robot begged you not to shut it off, would you show compassion?
In an experiment designed to investigate how people treat robots when they act like humans, many participants struggled to power down a pleading robot, named Nao, either refusing to shut it off or taking more than twice the amount of time to pull the plug.</description>

He was 85.
His family confirmed the death in a statement, The Associated Press reported.</description>

      <description>Elon Musk is playing a dangerous game There is never a dull moment with the mercurial Mr Musk, but he excelled himself on Tuesday, stunning the markets by tweeting that he was considering taking the company private by buying publicly available shares for $420 each - a significant premium to the $340 they were trading at before he dropped his bombshell.
If it turns out his Twitter promise - that he has secured the tens of billions of dollars he would need to buy out public shareholders - is in any way shaky, then he could find himself accused of price manipulation.</description>

      <description>The strange birth, death and rebirth of a Russian troll account called &amp;ldquo;AllForUSA&amp;rdquo; An Indiana man named Jesse D. Allen created a website in 2005 with the title AllForUSA.com, apparently to pursue some business interests, but he soon abandoned the site. A decade later, at the age of 80, Allen died.
But AllForUSA was just getting started.
As the 2016 presidential campaign heated up, AllForUSA.com suddenly bristled with what appeared to be news articles celebrating Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and bashing his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.</description>

      <description>Test-doctoring to keep Japanese women out of medical school Japan has made a lot of noise in recent years about demolishing the traditional view that women should stay at home while men go out to work. So it was shocking when, on August 7th, Tokyo Medical University, a prestigious medical school, confessed to marking down the test scores of female applications to keep the ratio of women in each class below 30%.</description>

      <description>China&amp;rsquo;s introverts find a kindred spirit: a stick figure from Finland People who live in China&amp;rsquo;s crowed cities are used to having their personal space invaded - in schools, malls, restaurants, bus stations, dormitories and even bathrooms. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they like it.
Now a growing number of them identify with a Finnish cartoon character who channels their urban anxieties, albeit in a different cultural context.
The &amp;ldquo;Finnish Nightmares&amp;rdquo; comic series documents the social challenges faced by Matti, a mild-mannered stick figure who abhors small talk.</description>
