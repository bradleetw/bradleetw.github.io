## Test-doctoring to keep Japanese women out of medical school

Japan has made a lot of noise in recent years about !demolishing the traditional view that women should stay at home while men go out to work. So it was shocking when, on August 7th, Tokyo Medical University, a !prestigious medical school, !confessed to marking down the test scores of female applications to keep the ratio of women in each class below 30%.

Their !defence was that women are more likely to !drop out to marry and have children. To judge female applications to medical school purely on their !merits would leave Japan with a shortage of doctors, they said. The !admission has caused !outrage.

!Doctoring has long been a male !bastion. But it is not the only one. Discrimination is !rife in banks and trading houses, where !stamina and !loyalty, qualities somehow associated with men, are !prized, says Mari Miura, a political scientist at Sophia University.

All this !embarrasses a government that has promised to make womne "!shine", its !condescending !catchphrase for female !empowerment. The policy seems based on the need for more workers rather than on !genuine concern for women. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, says he wants to bring millions more women into the workforce to make up for a labour !shortfall caused by its !ageing and !declining population.

In the filed of politics, the record under Mr Abe's !premiership is !lamentable. Just two members of his 20-strong !cabinet are women, including Seiko Noda, in charge of women's empowerment. Ms Noda, who makes little secret of her ambition to !dethrone Mr Abe in a leadership !contest next month, has just published a book called "Grab the Future", her !manifesto for pulling Japan into line with "global standards". She has almost no chance of winning.
