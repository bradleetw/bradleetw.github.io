      <description>&amp;lsquo;Please do not switch me off !&amp;rsquo;: An experiment with a begging robot shows people hesitate to pull the plug If a little humanoid robot begged you not to shut it off, would you show compassion?

      <description>The strange birth, death and rebirth of a Russian troll account called &amp;ldquo;AllForUSA&amp;rdquo; An Indiana man named Jesse D. Allen created a website in 2005 with the title AllForUSA.com, apparently to pursue some business interests, but he soon abandoned the site. A decade later, at the age of 80, Allen died.

As the 2016 presidential campaign heated up, AllForUSA.com suddenly bristled with what appeared to be news articles celebrating Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and bashing his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.</description>
